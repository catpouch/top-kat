# top-kat

Python bindings to the [streaming_algorithms](https://docs.rs/streaming_algorithms/latest/streaming_algorithms/) Rust crate. Includes the following algorithms:
- Count-min sketch
- HyperLogLog
- Simple random sample
- Unstable reservoir sample
- Top-K

## Installation

```pip install top-kat```
Appears as top_kat in code.

## Notes

The aforementioned Rust crate is a work in progress and has not been updated in 3 years, so incomplete documentation has leaked into this package.
If you run across any features that are not properly explained and need to be used, refer to the crate's source code (sorry lol).
